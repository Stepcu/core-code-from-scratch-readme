# Interpreted and Compiled Programming Languages
1. Compiled Languagues are converted directly into machine code, they tend to be faster and more efficient than the Interpreted Language. It requires an aditional step before executing since it needs to convert our code to machine language. Some compiled languages are: C++, C, GO. 
2. The Interpreted Language goes through the instructions and interprets them one by one, every time the program is executed. They are a little bit slower than the compiled languages but with the development of just-in-time-compilation this is decreasing. Some Interpreted languages are: JavaScript, PHP, Python.
3. The JAVA programming language can be considered as a Hybrid because it can be either an Interpreted Language or a Compiled Language. It is first compiled into bytecode and then interpreted.
